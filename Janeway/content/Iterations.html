<h2>Iterations</h2>
<hr />
<p>
<pre>
Iterations are a segment of time.  They have a name along with a starting and end date.
The starting and ending points of iterations in a project cannot overlap.
By default, requirements are placed on a backlog.  Requirements must be edited to be assigned to iterations.
