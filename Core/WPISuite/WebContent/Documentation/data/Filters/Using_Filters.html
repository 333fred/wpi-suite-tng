<h3>Using Filters</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
Once you create a filter (refer to Creating Filters for details), you may use them to separate requirements in the table view
<ul>
	<li>Click the &quot;Filters&quot; tab in the tree view if you haven't already</li>
	<br/>
	<div class= "note" ><font size = +5><b>ADD MORE TODAY</b></font><br>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<li>Requirement fields can be rearranged by clicking on a header and dragging it to a different spot on the table view</li>
</ul>
