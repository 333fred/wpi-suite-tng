<h3>Tree Filters</h3>
<hr />
<p>
	The tree view may be used to apply various filters. These filters include filtering by the backlog, filtering by iteration, and filtering by deleted. Once these filters are applied, the requirements under that filter will be displayed in the tabke view. Here is how to apply these filters:

	<ul>
		<li>Navigate to the &quot;Iterations&quot; tab in the tree view</li>
		<li>To filter requirements by the backlog, right click on the backlog folder and choose the &quot;Filter by Backlog&quot; option</li>
		<li>To filter requirements by the an iteration, right click on any iteration and choose the &quot;Filter by Iteration&quot; option</li>
		<li>To filter requirements by deleted, right click on the deleted folder and choose the &quot;Filter by Deleted&quot; option</li>

		<div class="figure" style="text-align:center">

		<img src="" data-path="images/TreeFilter.png" width="60%"/>
		<br><font size = -2>Filtering by Iteration 1</font><br><br></div>

		<li>To clear the filter, click the &quot;Clear Tree Filter&quot; button located at the bottom left of the table view</li>
	</ul>
