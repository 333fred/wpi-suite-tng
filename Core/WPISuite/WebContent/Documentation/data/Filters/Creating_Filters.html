<h3>Creating Filters</h3>
<hr />
<p>
	Navigate to the filters by clicking on the &quot;Filters&quot; tab in the requirement tree view in the left most panel of the Janeway client.
	<br>
	<br>
	You can filter out requirements in the table view by any of it's fields, which includes:
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Name</b>, <b>Type</b>, <b>Priority</b>, <b>Status</b>, <b>Iteration</b>, <b>Estimate</b>, <b>Effort</b>, and <b>Release Number</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Each field has unique filter options that can be used to separate requirements. The filters will require you to use dropdown menus that contain elements for each field or type in values that will be used for filtering purposes. Each filter contains a <b>Field</b>, and <b>Operation</b>, and a <b>Value</b> Here is a list of each Operation and what each one means:
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Equal:</b> The value for the filter will be equal to to value for the field specified.</li>
		<li><b>Not Equal:</b> Requirements with fields that do not equal the value of the filter will be separated and displayed.</li>
		<li><b>Starts With:</b> Requirements with a field that start with the value will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b>Contains:</b> Requirements with a field that contain the value will be filtered. The value can be anywhere in the specified field.</li>
		<li><b>Occurs Before:</b> Requirements in iterations that occur before a specific date will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b>Occurs After:</b> Requirements in iterations that occur after a specific date will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b>Occurs Between:</b> Requirements in iterations that occur between two specific dates will be filtered.</li><br>
		<div class= "note"> A small button located on the right side of the text box for the operations Occurs Before, Occurs After, and Occurs Between will be available that will display a calendar like the one seen in &quot;Creating an Iteration&quot; to choose dates.</div><br>
		<li><b> <: </b> Requirements with a field that is less than the value will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b> <= :</b> Requirements with a field that is less than or equal to the value will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b> >: </b> Requirements with a field that is greater than the value will be filtered.</li>
		<li><b> >= :</b> Requirements with a field that is greater than or equal to the value will be filtered.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	Now that you know what each operation is and how it functions, here is a list of each field, which operation they can use, and how to enter the value(s):
