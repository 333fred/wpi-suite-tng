<h3>Search Requirements By Name</h3>
<hr />
<p>
	You may search for requirements by their name in the table view. There is a small text box in the lower right corner of the Requirements manager where you may enter the name of a specific requirement you wish to search for.

	<div class="figure" style="text-align:center">
	<font size = -2>Click image to enlarge</font><br>
	<img src="" data-path="images/SearchBar.png" width="15%"/>
	<br><font size = -2>Add text so search for requirements by name</font><br><br></div>
 
	As you start typing in the search bar, the list of requirements will actively filter out the requirements. The list will now show the requirements with the names that start with the text you typed in the search bar. To get a full list of requirements back, delete the content in the search bar.
