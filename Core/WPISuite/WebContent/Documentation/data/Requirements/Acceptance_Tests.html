<h3>Acceptance Tests</h3>
<hr />
<p>
As a team member you may want to add an acceptance test to a requirement. If you are a customer, this is a high-level acceptance test. If you are a member of the development team you may be adding a more detailed and explicit test. To navigate to the tab for acceptance tests:
<ul>
	<li>open any requirement and click the &quot;Tests&quot; tab located in the right panel of Janeway</li>
</ul>
Team members may add acceptance tests for a Requirement:
<ul>
	<li>give the test a name and a description</li>
	<li>the save button in the lower right corner will become active which you may now click to save the acceptance test</li>
	<li>the new test will now appear in the window above</li>
	<li>the test may be edited by clicking on the test in the window. The name and description will appear in the text boxes below</li>
</ul>
Customers may access these acceptance tests and decide whether they pass or fail:
<ul>
	<li>The customer can click on the acceptance test where its data will appear in the text boxes below. There is a dropdown menu with two options: Pass and Fail. The customer can decide whether they think the test passes or fails by choosing either of these otions where they can then save the change by clicking the save button in the bottom right corner of the panel</li>
</ul>
