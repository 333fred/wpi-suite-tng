<h3>Iterations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Iterations are a segment of time. They have a name along with a starting and end date. The starting and ending points of iterations in a project cannot overlap. By default, requirements are placed on a backlog. Requirements must be edited to be assigned to iterations. </p>
