<h3>Closing Tabs</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Tabs that have been opened can be closed by clicking the small &quot;x&quot; in the actual tab or by right clicking the tab and choosing the &quot;close&quot; option.
<ul>
	<li>you may close all tabs by right clicking on any tab you have opened and choosing the &quot;Close All&quot; option</li>
	<li>If you want to keep one tab open, but no longer want other tabs open, you can right click on the tab you want to keep and choose the &quot;Close Others&quot; option</li>
</ul>
<br/>
	<div class= "note" > Since the Requirements tab may not be closed, you can right click on that tab and choose the &quot;Close Others&quot; option to close all opened tabs.
	</div>
