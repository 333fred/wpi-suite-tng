<h3>Permissions</h3>
<hr />
<p>
	Permissions determine what rights a user has and what they can do. Only administrators may edit permissions.<br><br>

	In order to edit permissions you must be assigned as an administrator on the current project.<br>
	The permission of the current user, as well as the 'admin' user can't be edited.<br>
	New users that are added to the project will have the Observer permission.
